<h2>Femsa, Heineken, save La Pastora</h2>


<p>Femsa wants to build a stadium in Monterrey, in the state of Nuevo León, México. Heineken recently bought the beer-brewing business of Femsa, and in exchange Femsa now owns 20% of Heineken.</p>

<p>Femsa wants this stadium to grow their soccer team business, Rayados, and to advertise and sell beer. Both the stadium and the soccer team are important marketing tools for their beer brands, now owned by Heineken. Heineken will benefit from this stadium and has shown support for it.</p>

<p>But they want to build it in a public park, called La Pastora. Their lobbying efforts have paid, and our state congress has ceded 25 hectares out of 155 in the park to them, for 60 years.</p>


<p>The law allows public land to be given on loan to private entities when the recipient vows to use it for a not-for-profit purpose that benefits the public. The law also states that these loans cannot last longer than 30 years. We wonder how will they avoid profiting from this stadium. Will they abstain from advertising their beer there? Will they sell it there at cost? Will they donate their soccer team profits? This concession runs over the law.</p>

<p>The land given to Femsa is worth at least 50 million US dollars. The government has offered them to invest an additional 50 million to improve roads and the remaining land in the park. Then the government of Nuevo León is giving a subsidy of about USD 100 million to one of the richest companies in Mexico. At the same time, 200.000 people live in extreme poverty in the state.</p>

<p>Monterrey is a large industrial city suffering from deep environmental and social problems. Most rivers crossing its valley have dried up. La Pastora is home to one of the few remaining rivers in the city that is not dry. There are very few parks in the city. We have made world news recently because of the drug wars being waged in our city. The violence and the gangs are partly caused by the lack of recreation spaces for our youth. Our government has been privatising public land the same way they are doing with La Pastora for many years.</p>

<p>We don't agree. Heineken, Femsa, please refrain from building that stadium in La Pastora. </p>
