<h2>Femsa, Heineken, save La Pastora</h2>

<p>Femsa wants to build a stadium in the city of Monterrey in the state of Nuevo León, México. Heineken recently bought the beer-brewing business of Femsa, and in exchange Femsa now owns 20% of Heineken.</p>

<p>Femsa wants this stadium to grow their soccer team business, Rayados, and to advertise and sell beer. Both the stadium and the soccer team are important marketing tools for their beer brands, now owned by Heineken. Heineken will benefit from this stadium and has shown support for it.</p>

<p>But they want to build it in a public park, called La Pastora. Their lobbying efforts, and the suspicious blindness of our government has paid, and our state congress ceded 25 hectares out of 130 in the park to them.</p>

<p>The land belongs to the public, but it has been ceded for 60 years to these companies. The law allows this only when the recipient vows to use it for a not-for-profit purpose that benefits the public. Well, a soccer stadium could be seen as a benefit for the public, but Femsa cannot claim its aims to be non-profit because Rayados is a big business that will grow with this stadium.</p>

<p>When land is ceded like this in Nuevo León, the recipient must present return of investment estimates to justify the time the land is received on loan. They have claimed they will need 60 years to recover their investment, with conservative estimates of usage and rental fees. But how much more profitable will Rayados be on the new stadium? How much will their beer bussiness improve with sales and advertising there? It's deceptive to claim the stadium is a not-for-profit venture when most of the profits will go to their other businesses.</p>

<p>The land given to Femsa is probably worth US $50 million. The government has offered them to invest an additional USD $50 million to improve roads and the remaining land of the park. Then the government of Nuevo León is giving a subsidy of about USD $100 million to one of the richest companies in Mexico. At the same time, 200 thousand people live in extreme poverty in the state.</p>

<p>Monterrey is a large industrial city suffering from deep environmental and social problems. Most rivers crossing its valley have dried up. La Pastora is home to one of the few remaining rivers in the city that is not dry. There are very few parks in the city. We have made world news recently because of the drug wars being waged in our city. The violence and the gangs are partly caused by the lack of recreation spaces for our youth. Our government has been privatising public land the same way they are doing with La Pastora for many years.</p>

<p>We don't agree: Femsa, Heineken, Government of Nuevo León, please refrain from building that stadium in La Pastora.</p>
